He dreams of becoming an Engineer. So far the topics Laws of Motion and Relational motion have been covered in school and he finds them easy. He enjoys working with real life problems around gravity and acceleration. He feels like he “knows” Physics and these concepts come naturally to him. He has also started preparing for Engineering entrances and has been going for IIT coaching since the session began. While walking back from one of these coaching sessions he wishfully thinks about how it would be to work at NASA, more so if he could become an astronaut. It would be so exciting to go into space. What if his dog Simba could come along too? He laughs imagining how he would look funny in the spacesuit. Sometimes he wonders about how microgravity really works and how we end up floating in space.

He is diligent about spending a few hours daily on each PCM subject, solving problems. He mostly feels like he is on top of everything but sometimes finds Math tough. Today in tuition class a new topic of Integral Calculus was introduced. Advik has never done this before and is curious about it. As the class goes on, he tries to make sense of what Mr Talwar is explaining. But most of it goes above his head. His friend Aadya, who is not feeling as interested in the class is busy scribbling a picture of Mr Calculus on her notebook as an imitation of Mr Talwar. Advik and Aadya break into a giggle but Advik quickly regains his composure. A few hours later in the evening, he takes out his Math book and sits down to understand the concepts again. After juggling for about a half an hour he feels that he is still struggling with it. “Yes basically it is a summation, but what are these expressions coming from? Where do we use this in real life?” He feels bothered and frustrated.\",\n            \"media\": \"public/music/rgblrkgbkl.3414234.mp3\",\n            \"questions\": [\n                \"62f0a2291e339c75cabd518d\",\n                \"62f0a2291e339c75cabd518e\",\n                \"62f0a2291e339c75cabd518f\"\n            ],\n            \"__v\": 0\n        },\n        {\n            \"_id\": \"62f0a8601e339c75cabd51a4\",\n            \"title\": \" Definite AND Indefinite\",\n            \"description\": \" A distorted view\",\n            \"story\": \"Next day in school the Math teacher Ms Sheila announces that she will start teaching Calculus early since there is a lot of course content to cover.

He enjoys working with real life problems around gravity and acceleration. He feels like he “knows” Physics and these concepts come naturally to him. He has also started preparing for Engineering entrances and has been going for IIT coaching since the session began. While walking back from one of these coaching sessions he wishfully thinks about how it would be to work at NASA, more so if he could become an astronaut. It would be so exciting to go into space. What if his dog Simba could come along too? He laughs imagining how he would look funny in the spacesuit. Sometimes he wonders about how microgravity really works and how we end up floating in space.

They have just finished a crazy deadline they were chasing and are relieved and completely stress free. They have their shopping list ready and have just got their salary for the month. They are excited and looking forward to the evening. While browsing in a store, Myra’s phone rings. She sees it’s from her manager! Because Myra believes it is something bad about which the boss has called, she’s worried, scared and frustrated, she doesn’t pick up his call. She finds it easier to text him instead. She drops a message saying she is unable to pick up the phone right now and she hopes everything is okay? She feels if he has to criticize her work it would be easier to hear it over text. Guess what the boss responds? “I called by mistake”\",\r\n    \"storyExplaination\": {\r\n        \"beleif\": \"In the context of the story, let’s try to understand the interplay of thoughts, behaviors and feelings given a situation. Situation Myra got a call from her boss. This was the only thing that happened In that situation, she believed that her work was the issue and the boss would be upset.Now based on her perception, she had anxious thoughts and felt worried.And finally, based on her thoughts and feelings, she acted by not answering the phone and texting instead. So although this type of reactive behavior might appear to help in the short term by reducing the immediate anxiety. But in the long run, these can actually reinforce negative unhealthy patterns or cycles that may be difficult to break out of. Experts say that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors affect each other. When an outside situation happens and we find it challenging, we often lose our objectivity and go into a reactive mode of repetitive unhealthy thinking patterns. Such thinking patterns give rise to stressful feelings that make us even more miserable. Finding ourselves caught in this loop of negative thoughts and feelings, we may even lose control of our behavior and start acting in ways that may be destructive to ourselves and others. So is there anything we can do about this endless loop of irrational thoughts, feelings and destructive behaviors? Well yes. In the last lessons we have learnt that not being influenced by our beliefs, rather finding evidence or truth in the situations and responding accordingly helps us. But how do we learn to do that? There are many techniques. We will see these through further lessons about how we can learn to recognise unhelpful patterns in our thoughts, accept them without judgment and generate more rational and evidence based thoughts and perspectives.

But in the long run, these can actually reinforce negative unhealthy patterns or cycles that may be difficult to break out of. Experts say that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors affect each other. When an outside situation happens and we find it challenging, we often lose our objectivity and go into a reactive mode of repetitive unhealthy thinking patterns. Such thinking patterns give rise to stressful feelings that make us even more miserable. Finding ourselves caught in this loop of negative thoughts and feelings, we may even lose control of our behavior and start acting in ways that may be destructive to ourselves and others. So is there anything we can do about this endless loop of irrational thoughts, feelings and destructive behaviors? Well yes. In the last lessons we have learnt that not being influenced by our beliefs, rather finding evidence or truth in the situations and responding accordingly helps us. But how do we learn to do that?

Ashok keeps hearing from Myra about how she has slowly begun to transform her life by working on her limiting beliefs including how she had believed all this time that she could never get promoted. She is both excited about her new journey and embarrassed to share this. Ashok on the other hand startles Myra by telling her that he has also had many such harmful beliefs, still does. For example, for a long time he believed that he was not a good leader. He was always very self critical and a perfectionist and never found his achievements satisfying. And even though he got frequent promotions and was popular as a colleague he never believed the success. But he found a secret to looking differently and since then has been on a positive journey. Ashok’s new approach in life comes from doing deep work on himself. He started experimenting with various techniques and methods that could help him come out of those sticky beliefs.

For example you are a Director in a technical company but unable to solve technical problems as well as you used to when you were younger. Now your current position may only require you to have good business and manageJennyl skills which you may really be good at but you just unnecessarily compare yourself with your younger self or someone who is good technically and think that you should be like him or her. So now you realistically check all the good qualities you have that are needed for this particular leadership role.\"\r\n                ]\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                 \"heading\": \"The other thing that helps a lot here is Developing a whole perspective- (Good AND bad)\",\r\n                \"points\": [\r\n                    \" Sometimes your assumptions or beliefs may not be completely faulty and there may be some truth there. For example, the thought “I am not a good leader” may be backed up by these truths about me -“ I don’t communicate well” and “I am hard on people when they commit mistakes”. But this may be an incomplete picture. There may be additional evidence to suggest that there are some goods in me too that I have been ignoring. For example, “Everyone voted for me as a great mentor just last week”. And “I give constructive feedback”. So it is only partially true that “I am not a good leader”. The reality is that there is both good and bad in me or we can say room for improvement. This is how we can make a shift from an extreme perspective- “I am not a good leader” to a balanced and whole perspective- “I have some qualities of a good leader, and there is room for improvement”. Now that I have these new helpful thoughts, I can feel and act from a place of balance and be more whole and happier.\",\r\n                    \"Now in light of these two strategies- Finding the evidence and developing a Whole view - try to generate Alternate thoughts for yourself. For example for Ashok, they can be, “It may be true that I am not the best leader out there but I am surely doing well” or “I am liked by all but I feel I have some areas to work on”. These are more truthful and whole ways to look at the situation. Once you write down alternative thoughts like these, also note down what feelings and behaviors can be associated with these. Now you can practice this daily and create a shift in your perspective towards healthy ways of thinking.\"\r\n                   \r\n                ]\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"heading\": \"The challenge of negative emotions\",\r\n                \"points\":[\r\n                    \"Sometimes when we are feeling low it may be difficult to generate such alternate thoughts.

Guess what? That’s another extreme way of thinking, another distortion called “All or none” or “Black and white” thinking. It is actually true that multiple distortions are possible in our mind at the same time. That is the benefit of practicing the thought diary.
